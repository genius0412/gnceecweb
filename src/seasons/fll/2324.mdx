# Pre-Season
## LOCKED IN
We were **extremely** determined. From looking at other robots last year, we were inspired to score max points this year.
To accomplish this goal, we started by designing a custom chassis using [Bricklink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/main.page).
We had access to a SPIKE PRIME this year, which was helpful. After numerous iterations, we came up with an effective design.

## Chassis
The chassis included these features.
- Two large blue wheels powered by two large motors
- Two medium motors for attachments
- Two color sensors
- One ball bearing in the front for stability

Originally, the gear from the medium motors meshed with the attachments using normal gears. However, the gears slipped extremely easily, so we switched to a dog gear. This eliminated gear slipping completely.
