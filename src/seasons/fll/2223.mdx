# Team Formation
In 2022, new FLL teams were formed based on days people were available on. We were the only team that met on Wednesdays. Some swapped teams due to availability. People who remained were lucky! In the beginning, some possible team names were brainstormed. Then, we decided on Electrified Chickens democratically. It was inspired by the season theme and GNCE. The members were Adrian C, Diego S, Dohun K, Ethan Zha, Johan C, Kevin C, Lucas W, Tate C, and Tucker C.<br/><br/>
# Rough Start
It was a rough start. No one knew anything, and we started by reading through the rulebook. We made a Google Doc with all the missions typed up and found out the maximum amount of points. <br/><br/>
The chassis was created by Adrian C, and it was a basic chassis that used one motor for an arm. <br/><br/>
# Robot Game
Not much thought went into creating attachments. Heck, we barely knew what attachments were. We had one arm to do everything, and went straight to coding. <br/><br/>
Everyone wanted to code. There were often minor conflicts because someone coded for longer than others. <br/><br/>
# Innovation Project
Based off of the big question, we came up with three branches we wanted to go with. <br/><br/>
