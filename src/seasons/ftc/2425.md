# Members
Transitioning from FLL, the member limit increased. We had three more people join the team, and one left due to personal reasons. Our members this year were: Adrian C, Anson S, Diego S, Dohun K, Ethan Zha, **Ethan Zhu**, Johan C, **Jonah H**, ~~Kevin C~~, **Leo L**, Lucas W, Tucker C.
# Pre-Season
Rex L from GNCE Carbon & Mr. Gumbert, then head coach, hosted a CAD learning session for new teams. People who were able participated and got a head start.
# Early Season
## Kickoff
From the kickoff event, we learned many things about FTC, including custom manufacturing and SparkFun OTOS.
## Strategy
From examining the field, we realized that the submersible was accessible while hanging a specimen on the rungs. From this, we decided that it would be best if we could **intake and outtake from the same side** for parallel action. This meant that we would need a separate intake and outtake. By carefully measuring the heights and lengths, we decided to go with 5 SAR230 Misumi drawer slides on each side for outtake and 4 SAR220 Misumi drawer slides on each side for intake. (Note: Intake is later changed to 3 SAR220s on each side.)
## Chassis Selection
Even though we had learned how to create a parallel plate chassis during the CAD learning sessions, we decided to go with a basic kit chassis from GoBilda.
## Intake Prototype
This year, the game pieces, or samples, were very hard to pick up due to the sample having multiple orientations and the submersible being randomized. Therefore, we decided that an active intake would be beneficial. An active intake would allow us to intake from the submersible easier during auto, as a claw intake would require Object Detection.
## Platforms
Since the sample could be in multiple orientations, we thought a transfer platform that orients the sample in one direction would be helpful.

	<p>Iteration 1.
This platform utilized a curved surface to align the sample, just like a funnel. However, it was bulky, and when the sample was perfectly horizontal, it got stuck.</p>

### V2
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row space-x-4 items-center">
	<p>Iteration 2.
This platform used a bump on one side to tilt the sample before properly aligning it with a curve. This design worked very smoothly for us, except at this point, we didnâ€™t need an alignment platform anymore, because we had changed our intake.</p>

	<p>Iteration 1.
Our first iteration featured a box-like structure with an axle running through the center, housing multiple boot wheels. A GoBilda Super Speed Servo powered the boot wheels. Our goal with this design was to have the sample go through the bucket and come out the other way. <br/><br/>This design was effective at collecting the samples, but it failed to move them all the way through because the surface was perpendicular. </p>
